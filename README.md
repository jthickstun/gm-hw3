# Generative Models: Homework 3 #

In this part of [Homework 3](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599i/20au/resources/hw3.pdf) (Problems 5 and 6) your will implement a GAN, and run experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

You can download the datasets [__here__](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599i/20au/resources/hw3data.tar.gz) (extract them to the `data/` directory in the root of this repository). I've provided code for loading and processing this data into minibatches in `mnist.py` and `cifar10.py`.

Scaffolding for your GAN models is provided in `models.py` and `utils.py`.

Framework code for training your models is found in `mnist.ipynb` (Problem 5) and `cifar10.ipynb` (Problem 6). I recommend using Google Colab to execute these notebooks (with a GPU accelerator attached).
